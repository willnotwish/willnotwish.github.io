Back in the day (2012 maybe), you could add multiple domains that you owned to your basic Google "apps for business" account. Not just a domain alias, but the domain itself. For free.

These days, that's not possible and you [have to pay](https://cloud.googleblog.com/2012/12/changes-to-google-apps-for-businesses.html).

You also have to search for the domain management bit once you're at the admin dashboard.
